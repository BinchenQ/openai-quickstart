# Introduction
This Python application creates an interactive chatbot designed to provide information related to real estate sales data and other domains (e.g., home appliances, devOps). It leverages the Gradio library for a user-friendly interface, LangChain for integrating with the OpenAI API, and FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval of document embeddings. The chatbot can answer queries by retrieving relevant information from uploaded documents or engage in conversation using the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

# Key Features
- File Processing: Users can upload text files which are then split into chunks and indexed using FAISS, with metadata indicating their category (e.g., real estate).

- Topic-based Retrieval: Queries are processed against a vector database filtered by a selected topic ('realEstate', 'homeAppliances', 'devOps'), enhancing the relevance of responses.

- Dynamic Database Update: New files can be added to the existing database, updating the knowledge base dynamically.

- Chat Interface: A Gradio-powered chat interface allows users to interactively ask questions and receive answers based on the indexed data or generated by the language model.

# Future Enhancements
- Contextual Switching: The chatbot can switch between topics on demand, adapting its response strategy according to user selections.
